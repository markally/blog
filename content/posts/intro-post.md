We're currently in the midst of COVID-19 work from home, and we're in it for the long haul -- Facebook and Google will be at home until 2021, with Amazon (where I work) planning a return in October ([source](https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/sns-nyt-white-collar-companies-not-returning-to-office-20200510-kmpqx5ifujhvxkrkwmpyjn5p4y-story.html)). At this stage, I think we're all aware that remote work can be really effective but that it also has very real costs. For me one of the biggest costs has been the disappearance of desk chatter, which I apparently depend on to grow as a manager.

## Missing Feedback

Consider two cases:
1. I have a one-on-one with someone where I have to give mixed news: That project they wanted to work on? We're not going to be able to get to it. But there's a new project that popped up, and it's really exciting and checks off these other goals you had! What do you think?
2. Someone drops by another manager's desk and asks a quick question. Perhaps its a clarification about strategy, or prioritization, or to let them know something has gone wrong. 

In case one, I have a private conversation and I do my best to get feedback in the meeting. But in reality, I keep getting feedback throughout the day -- when that person gets back to their desk, what's their mood like? Do they crack jokes with the team, do they happily jump back into work, or do they immediately take a break and grab a drink?

In case two, a conversation that would typically be private (or in a meeting that I'm not a part of) happens, and I get to see how someone else handles it and how it goes. Likewise I get the follow on feedback after the conversation ends.

In this remote world I get less feedback on my actions, and I also learn less from peers and role models. It's really hard to tell what "good" looks like, and how I can get there. Honestly it's left me a bit lost and demotivated.

## My Solution

Buy a bunch of books.

Since it's harder to learn from myself and my peers, let's learn from experts instead. I scoured blog posts, reddit, hackernews and reading lists to get a set of books I thought would be helpful. This blog is meant to be a way to hold myself accountable to reading them, and to do the deep thinking required to write about them.

Here's the list of books in no particular order, along with the publisher's description. 

[Elastic Leadership: Growing self-organizing teams](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1617293083): Elastic leadership is a framework and philosophy that can help you as you manage day-to-day and long-term challenges and strive to create the elusive self-organizing team. It is about understanding that your leadership needs to change based on which phase you discover that your team is in. This book provides you with a set of values, techniques, and practices to use in your leadership role.

[Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager](https://smile.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering-ebook/dp/B01J53IE1O): Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland. Many of the stories first appeared in primitive form in Lopp’s perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose. The Third Edition of Managing Humans contains a whole new season of episodes from the ongoing saga of Lopp's adventures in Silicon Valley, together with classic episodes remastered for high fidelity and freshness.

[High Output Management](https://smile.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK): In this legendary business book and Silicon Valley staple, the former chairman and CEO (and employee number three) of Intel shares his perspective on how to build and run a company.

[The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](https://smile.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F/): Managing people is difficult wherever you work. But in the tech industry, where management is also a technical discipline, the learning curve can be brutal—especially when there are few tools, texts, and frameworks to help you. In this practical guide, author Camille Fournier (tech lead turned CTO) takes you through each stage in the journey from engineer to technical manager.

[Behind Closed Doors: Secrets of Great Management](https://smile.amazon.com/Behind-Closed-Doors-Management-Programmers-ebook/dp/B00A4OA6UQ): Great management is difficult to see as it occurs. It's possible to see the results of great management, but it's not easy to see how managers achieve those results. Great management happens in one-on-one meetings and with other managers---all in private. It's hard to learn management by example when you can't see it.

[The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering](https://smile.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Anniversary-Software-Engineering-ebook/dp/B00B8USS14): Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system. Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.
